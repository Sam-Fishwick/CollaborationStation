new file in feature branch
a new line on the feature branch only (presumably)

log:
- added feature branch, checked out to feature branch, and added this .txt
file.
- Checked out to main branch and expected this .txt file to disappear from
local directory, but it remained.
- Checked out again to feature branch and added, committed, and pushed this
.txt file to feature branch.
- Checked out again to main branch and this .txt file disappeared from local
directory, which is cool.

Conclusion:
- Local directory won't react to git branching unless appropriate directories
or files are committed.

Merging feature branch to main with this .txt being the only difference.
- git checkout main
- git merge feature 
- successfully merged (changes to Luke's Log on main branch unaffected by merge)
