Cloned repo directly from Sam's GitHub using the URL in my terminal
    >  git clone https://github.com/Sam-Fishwick/MyFirstRepo

Created Log using vim
    >  vim Luke\'s\ Log

Updated Log then committed
    >  git add .
    >  git status
    >  git commit -m "Created Lukes Log"

Attempted to push, met with authentication error because I cloned from Sam's GitHub
    > git push
    remote: Invalid username or password.
    fatal: Authentication failed for 'https://github.com/Sam-Fishwick/MyFirstRepo/'

Learned that I have to Fork the repo to my GitHub, then clone that version
I forked using the website, and cloned using my terminal
    >  git clone https://github.com/LucasFishwicas/MyFirstRepo

Repeated process of creating Luke's Log.
Attempted to push
    > git push
    Username for 'https://github.com': LucasFishwicas
    Password for 'https://LucasFishwicas@github.com':
    remote: Support for password authentication was removed on August 13, 2021.
    remote: Please see https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/getting-started-
    with-git/about-remote-repositories#cloning-with-https-urls for information on 
    currently recommended modes of authentication.
    fatal: Authentication failed for 'https://github.com/LucasFishwicas/MyFirstRepo/'

Authentication failed - I think I need to create an authentication key

Followed the link and it confirmed, reading:
    "Password-based authentication for Git has been removed in favor of more secure authen-
    tication methods. For more information, see "Creating a personal access token.""

    "Personal access tokens function like ordinary OAuth access tokens. They can
    be used instead of a password for Git over HTTPS, or can be used to authenticate
    to the API over Basic Authentication. "

Created Token

Push Successful
But I think I should have created a Pull Request instead of Cloning

Attempted Pull Request
It appears that the Pull Request is Requesting Sam to Merge my forked changes to his main branch

Merged

Updated Log
    >  git commit -m "Updated Log after Merge"


Accepted Sam's Collaboration Invitation
I then cloned the repository directly from his GitHub
    >  git clone https://github.com/Sam-Fishwick/CollaborationStation
